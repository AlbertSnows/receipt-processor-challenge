Answering basic questions

## What's the teck stack

We're using java with the spring boot framework, H2 as the in-memory db

## Isn't that overkill?

For this kind of project? Yes.

## Then why choose this tech stack?

Spring Boot is doing a lot of interesting things with their framework that I want to learn more about. This is as much a
project for evaluation as it is a chance to grokk Spring Boot's framework. This solution could have just as easily (
actually, probably much more easily) been implemented in Node JS w/ Express, or any other mature API framework.
